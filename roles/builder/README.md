# infra.osbuild.builder

This role automates [osbuild](https://www.osbuild.org/) [compose builds](https://www.osbuild.org/guides/user-guide/user-guide.html)
using the osbuild backend [Weldr](https://weldr.io/) API.

## Requirements

The role requires a system to be running the `osbuild-composer` service which
the `infra.osbuild.builder` role will automate the deployment of.

## Role Variables

### builder_custom_repos

Type: complex
Required: false

Custom list of RPM repositories to make available to the
[osbuild](https://www.osbuild.org/) [compose builds](https://www.osbuild.org/guides/user-guide/user-guide.html).

Each list entry is a [YAML dictionary](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html)
type and has the following attributes:

| Variable Name | Type                              | Required  | Default Value |

    type: yum-baseurl
    check_ssl: true
    check_gpg: true
    state: present

```

### builder_rhsm_repos

Type: list
Required: false

List of RHSM repositories to make available to the
[osbuild](https://www.osbuild.org/) [compose builds](https://www.osbuild.org/guides/user-guide/user-guide.html).

Example:

```yaml
builder_rhsm_repos:
  - "rhocp-4.12-for-rhel-{{ ansible_distribution_major_version }}-{{ ansible_architecture }}-rpms"
  - "fast-datapath-for-rhel-{{ ansible_distribution_major_version }}-{{ ansible_architecture }}-rpms"
```

#### NOTES

osbuild performs builds in [multiple stages](https://www.osbuild.org/guides/developer-guide/osbuild.html?highlight=stage#osbuild)
and if an `*-installer` compose type is defined for `builder_compose_type`, as
defined below, then the build pipeline will include a stage that will create an
ISO Image that can be installed from. The ISO Installer stage has a different
set of package requirements and can sometimes cause package conflicts with the
contents of custom repositories. Therefore, **the repositories defined in this
variable are enabled only for the installable payload the installer will put on
disk, not the bootable ISO itself** and these repositories will be disabled
after the payload build is completed or has failed. In the event content from the
custom repos is required for an `*-installer` compose type (such as customer
drivers are needed), please set the `builder_custom_repos_persist` value to `true`.

### builder_custom_repos_persist

Type: bool
Required: false

This variable will cause custom repositories provided in the `builder_custom_repos`
variable to persist for all osbuild stages.

### builder_blueprint_name

Type: string
Required: false

This is the name of the [osbuild blueprint](https://www.osbuild.org/guides/blueprint-reference/blueprint-reference.html?highlight=distro#distribution-selection-with-blueprints)
to use. The blueprint will be auto generated based on the contents of the
`builder_compose_customizations` role variable. In the event an of an [rpm-ostree](https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
based compose type specified by the `builder_compose_type` role variable, the
blueprint name defined in this variable will use used to define the resulting [ostree](https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/)
repository.

### builder_blueprint_src_path

Type: string
Required: false

This is the path to a location on the osbuild server that the generated
blueprint should be stored at and used as the source content for the osbuild
compose build.

### builder_ostree_url

Type: string
Required: false

This variable is used to pass the ostree repo url of a previously built commit
to build an installer from. When this variable is not defined a new commit will
be built for the installer.

Example:

```yaml
builder_ostree_url: "http://0.0.0.0/test_blueprint_aap/repo/"
```

### builder_blueprint_ref

Type: string
Required: false

This variable need not be set and is only used when an
[rpm-ostree](https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) based image is
defined in the `builder_compose_type` variable. The `builder_blueprint_ref`
variable defines the [ostree](https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/) ref (branch)
to commit the ostree payload to in the resulting ostree repository on the
osbuild server.

### builder_compose_type

Type: string
Required: false

This variable defines the type of compose desired, valid inputs will vary based
on operating system (RHEL, CentOS Stream, or Fedora) and release version therin.

For RHEL, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Documentation Team publishes these and
they can be found [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/composing_a_customized_rhel_system_image/index#composer-output-formats_composer-description).

For CentOS Stream and Fedora, you will need to reference the output of the
`composer-cli compose types` command on the osbuild server (this can also be
done on RHEL if preferred).

### builder_wait_compose_timeout

Type: int
Required: false

The amount of time in seconds that the wait_compose module will wait for a build
to complete before failing. By default wait_compose waits for 1800 seconds unless
this variable is set.

Example:

```yaml
builder_wait_compose_timeout: 2400
```

### builder_enforce_auth

Example:

```yaml
builder_enforce_auth: true
```

### builder_password

Type: string

`builder_password` or `builder_pub_key` / `builder_pub_key_path` needs
to be defined for system authentication.

### builder_pub_key_path

Type: string
Required: false

Path to location of ssh public key to inject into the resulting image to allow
key-based ssh functionality without extra configuration for systems installed
with the resulting build media.

`builder_password` or `builder_pub_key` / `builder_pub_key_path` needs
to be defined for system authentication.

Example:

```yaml
builder_pub_key_path: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### builder_pub_key

Type: string
Required: false

SSH public key to inject into the resulting image to allow
key-based ssh functionality without extra configuration for systems installed

`builder_password` or `builder_pub_key` / `builder_pub_key_path` needs
to be defined for system authentication.

Example:

```yaml
builder_pub_key: ssh-rsa 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 resolutecoder@fedora
```
